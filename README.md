# Determinant-Quantum-Monte-Carlo
Contains DQMC implementation of Fermi Hubbard model. The repo is divided into two sections;

1) Scripts for compiling and running QMC codes(legacy and QUEST) on HPC clusters at Ohio State University.
2) Extracting correlation functions (static and dynamic) from raw QMC files, performing averages and creating separate data files for each relevant correlation functions.
3) Scripts for performing analytic continuation using Maximum Entropy methods, using both fermionic and bosonic kernels.
